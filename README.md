# Student-Management-System
This is a program I wrote to realize a library management system based on single linked list in C language, and can realize the basic functions of addition, deletion, modification and query. Book information can contain multiple data. When we need to save the data in the linked list locally, we can use file read-write to write the data into the created file.
